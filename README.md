# Support-Vector-Machine-with-Scikit

Applying SVM model to the Iris data in scikit library, I got the following result after evaluating,

SVM's Classification report shows,

| | Precison | Recall| F-score | support |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 0 |  1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 14 |
| 1 | 1.00 | 0.94 | 0.97 | 17 |
| 2 | 0.93 | 1.00 | 0.97 | 14 |
| avg/total | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 45 |

As, High Precision + High Recall = Highly accurate model.

Thus, SVM model gives 98% of the data which are truly relevant.
